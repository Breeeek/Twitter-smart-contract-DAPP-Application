# Twitter Smart Contract DApp

This project is a basic decentralized application (DApp) built using **JavaScript** for the frontend and **Solidity** for the smart contract. It enables users to interact with a smart contract deployed on the **Sepolia Test Network**. The application allows users to connect their Ethereum wallet and add tweets, showcasing the power of blockchain technology in social media applications.

## Features

- **Wallet Connection**: Users can connect their Ethereum wallet using MetaMask.
- **Add Tweets**: Once connected, users can add tweets to the blockchain via the smart contract.
- **Blockchain Storage**: Tweets are stored on the Sepolia test network, ensuring decentralization.
- **Smart Contract**: The smart contract is written in Solidity and deployed to the Ethereum network.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- **Smart Contract**: Solidity
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Sepolia Test Network)
- **Web3.js**: Library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain
- **MetaMask**: Ethereum wallet for interacting with the DApp


### Prerequisites

1. Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extension for your browser.
2. Create a MetaMask account and get some Sepolia test ETH from the [Sepolia faucet](https://faucet.sepolia.org/).
3. Clone the repository to your local machine.

1. Open the DApp in your browser.
2. Connect your Ethereum wallet (MetaMask).
3. Add a tweet to the blockchain by entering text into the form and clicking "Add Tweet".
4. The tweet will be stored on the blockchain, and you can interact with it as needed.
